### Genki 1 Ch 1 Notes

**X は Y です**
  - means "X is Y"
  - the topic/subject "X は" is typically omitted if it is clear from context
  - ex: "（今は）二十時です" = "(Now) it is 12:00." 

**Questions**
  - to turn a sentence into a question, add か to the end of the sentence.
  - "今は三時です" ("Now it is 3:00") => "今は三時ですか" ("Is it 3:00 now?")
  - questions may also contain a question word like "なん" (what); "なんX" typically means "what X":
    - "なんさいですか" => "How old (are you)?"
    - "でんわばんごうはなんですか" => "What is (your) phone number?"

**A の B**
  - の is a particle that connects two nouns: A の B indicates that B is a noun of type A.
  - A restricts the type of thing that the main idea B can be.
  - ex: "日本語の学生" => "student of the Japanese language" (a subset of all students)
