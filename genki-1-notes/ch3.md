### Genki Ch 3 Notes

#### Verb Categories and Conjugation

There are two regular categories of verbs: る-verbs and う-verbs. Their conjugation in the "present" (see below) tense is as follows:

| **Verb Category** | **Verb, Dictionary Form** | **Stem** | **Present Tense, Positive** | **Present Tense, Negative** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| る-verb | 食べる (to eat) | 食べ | 食べ**ます** | 食べ**ません** |
| う-verb | 行く (to go) | 行**き** | 行**きます** | 行**きません** |

- the stems of る-verbs will always end with る; the stems of う-verbs can end in any -う syllable, **including る**
- to conjugate a る-verb, remove the final る from the stem.
- to conjugate a う-verb, replace the final -う syllable from the stem with the corresponding -い syllable (so く turns into き, る turns into り, etc.)

There are also two irregular categories of verbs defined by the verbs くる (to come) and する (to do):

| **Verb, Dictionary Form** | **Stem** | **Present Tense, Positive** | **Present Tense, Negative** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| くる (to come) | **き** | きます | きません |
| する (to do; to make) | **し** | します | しません |

- these irregular categories include compound verbs like 勉強する (to study), which conjugates like する: "私は今日**勉強します**" => "I am studying today"

- it is necessary to memorize which group of verbs belongs to which category
  - aside from the irregular verbs, if a verb whose stem ends in る has a vowel ending in あ, う or お right before the final る, then it is an う-verb.
  - if such a verb has a vowel ending in い or え before the final る, then it is generally a る-verb **but this is not always the case** (see 帰る (to return) - its final vowel before the る is え but it is an う-verb)

### The Present Tense

The tense above is called the "present tense" but it can be used to describe actions that a person habitually or regularly performs, or actions that a person is planning to perform in the future:

"私はよくテレビを**見ます**" => "I often **watch** TV"

"私は明日東京に**行きます**" => "I **will go** to Tokyo tomorrow"

### Particles

Nouns in sentences generally must be followed by **particles**, which indicate their relationship to the verbs in sentence.

| **Particle** | **Meaning** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| を | Indicates that the preceding noun is a direct object, so it is directly involved in or affected by the action being described. Pronounced "*o*". | "私はテニス**を**します" => "I play tennis" |
| で | Indicates where the event described by the verb takes place. | "私は大学**で**勉強します" -> "I study **at** the university" |
| に | Can describe either the goal towards which things move, or the time at which an event takes place (see below) | "私は六時**に**うち**に**帰ります" => "I will return **to** home **at** 6:00" |
| へ | Can be used in place of に when describing the goal of movement. Pronounced "*e*". | "私は毎日大学**へ**行きます" => "I go **to** the university every day" |

### Word Order

Japanese sentences are generally comprised of noun/particle pairs followed by a verb or an adjective; the order of these is fairly flexible.

"私は月曜日に大学で日本語を勉強します" => "On Monday, I study Japanese at the university"

"毎日アメリカでハンバーガーを食べませんか" => "Would you like to eat hamburgers in America every day?"

### Time References and に

に is necessary for certain descriptions of time:

- when descibing the day of the week that something occurred, i.e. "on Sunday":
- numerical time expressions, like "at 10:00" or "in April":

"**月曜日に**大学に帰ります" => "I will return to university **on Monday**".

"**七時に**起きます" => "I get up **at 7:00**"

"**一月に**日本に行きます" => "I will go to Japan **in January**"

に is not used for the following descriptions of time:

- time expressions relative to the present moment, such as today and tomorrow
- expressions describing regular time intervals, like 毎日 (every day)
- the word いつ (when)

"**今日**大学に行きます" => "I will go to university **today**"

"**毎日**朝ご飯をたべます" => "I eat breakfast **every day**"

"**いつ**寝ますか" => "**When** do you sleep?"

に can be used in these descriptions of time, although it is unnecessary:

- parts of the day like 朝 (morning) or 晩 (night)
- the word 週末 (weekend)

"朝(に)コーヒーを飲みます" => "I drink coffee in the morning"

"週末(に)何をしますか" => "What will you do this weekend?"

Time references can be made approximate ("around...") by adding ごろ or substituting に with ごろに:

"十二時**ごろに**寝ます" => "I will sleep **at around** 12:00"

#### Extending Invitations with ませんか

The present tense negative verb, with the question particle か at the end, extends an invitation:

"朝ご飯を食べ**ませんか**" => "Would you like to have breakfast?"

Its affirmative counterpart, ますか, can only be construed as a question.

#### Frequency Adverbs

Adverbs like 毎日 (every day), よく (often), and 時々 (sometimes) can be used to describe how frequently an event occurs. These adverbs are used with the positive conjugation of the corresponding verb.

"**毎日**コーヒーを飲みます" => "I drink coffee **every day**"
"**時々**本を読みます" => "I **sometimes** read books"

Adverbs like ぜんぜん (never) and あまり (infrequently; rarely) anticipate the negative conjugation of its corresponding verb.

"あまりコーラを**飲みません**" => "I rarely drink cola"

"ぜんぜんテレビを**見ません**"= > "I never watch TV"

#### The Topic Particle は

There are instances where the topic particle は presents the subject of the sentence as its main topic:

"**私は**二年生です" => "**I am** a second-year"

A topic phrase doesn't need to be its main subject, however:

"**今日は**東京に行きます" => "(I am) going to Tokyo **today**"

Here, 今日 isn't the subject of the sentence (implicitly, the subject is the speaker), but it is presented as the main topic of the sentence via は (as in, the main topic of the sentence is **what the speaker is doing today**)

A: "テレビは？" => "(Will you) watch TV?"

B: "見ません" => "(I) won't (watch TV)"

In this exchange, は presents the main topic as テレビ which is the direct object in relation to the thought being expressed here (whether or not B will watch TV); in this case は is being used to direct speaker B to finish the thought presented by A.
