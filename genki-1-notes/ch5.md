### Genki Ch 5 Notes

#### Adjectives

2 regular conjugation groups, named after their endings in dictionary form: い-adjectives and な-adjectives (な-adjectives are also considered to just be nouns since they conjugate just like nouns)

In their dictionary forms, they can directly modify nouns:

"昨日, **面白い**映画を見ました" => "Yesterday, I watched an **interesting** movie."

"あそこは**元気な**犬です" => "There is an **energetic** dog over there."

Adjectives conjugate for tense and polarity, like verbs:

| **い-adjectives (except for いい (good))** | Positive | Negative |
| 寒い (cold) | --- | --- |
| Present | 寒い**です** (it **is** cold) | 寒**くないです** (it **was** cold) |
| Past | 寒**かったです** (it **was** cold) | 寒**くなかったです** (it **wasn't** cold) |

The adjective いい (good) and adjectives formed from いい like かっこいい (cool) are conjugated differently: the -いい is replaced by -よ except for the present positive conjugation:

| **いい-type adjectives** | Positive | Negative |
| いい (good) | --- | --- |
| Present | いいです (it is good) | **よ**くないです (it isn't good) |
| Past | **よ**かったです (it was good) | **よ**くなかったです (it wasn't good) |

For the negative conjugations, polite and formal forms exist as they do for nouns: 寒**くなありません** and よ**くありませんでした** for present and past negative, respectively.

な-adjectives conjugate like nouns, after dropping the -な:

| **な-type adjectives** | Positive | Negative |
| 元気な (healthy/energetic/well) | --- | --- |
| Present | 元気**です** (she is well) | 元気**じゃないです** (she isn't well) |
| Past | 元気**でした** (she was well) | 元気**じゃなかったです** (she wasn't well) |

The polite and formal negative conjugations for nouns can also be used here.

**Degree adverbs** can also be used before adjectives:

この犬は**とても**かわいいです => "That dog is **very** cute."

今日は**すごく**暑いです => "It is **extremely** hot today."

その部屋は**あまり**大きくないです => "That room is **not very** large."

#### 好き(な) and きらい(な)

好き(な) and きらい(な) mean "to like" and "to dislike" respectively, and are adjectives used to describe things that someone likes or dislikes:

XはYが(**好き/きらい**)です　=> "X (**likes/dislikes**) Y."

Note that が is used as the particle for Y, the thing being liked/disliked.

- If Y is a person, then Yが好きです can be taken as an admission of romantic interest.
- 大好き(な) and 大きらい(な) can be used to express stronger emotions, love or hate, respectively
- "好きでもきらいでもないです" expresses a lack of strong emotions either way; "I neither like nor dislike it"
- 好きな and きらいな can both be used to directly modify nouns:

これは私の**大好きな**本です => "This is a book **that I love**"

#### ~ましょう/~ましょうか

Conjugating a verb with ~ましょう or ~ましょうか can be used to suggest a plan; it's equivalent to "let's ..."

テレビを**見ましょう** => "**Let's watch** TV"
大学に**行きましょうか** => "**Should we go** to the university?"

#### Counter words

Counter words (~"X **things**, please") in Japanese come **after** the item being counted, and after the を particle:

ビルを**三つ**ください => "**3** beers, please"
きっぷを**一枚**買います => "I'll buy **1** ticket"

枚「まい」 is a counter for flat objects (sheets of paper, tickets, etc), -つ is a general purpose counter (it might not be right in the first example but should still be understood)
