### Genki Ch 4 Notes

#### Indicating Presence and Location with　あります and います

To say "There is X", where X is an object, we use the verbs ある and いる:

If X is an inanimate object or non-sentient animal, then the verb ある (う-verb) is used:

"本**があります**" => "**There is** a book"

"あそこ**に**カフェー**がありません**" => "**There is no** cafe over there"

Some notes:

- thing descriptions (本 and カフェ above) are followed by the が particle instead of the は particle as with other verbs
- place descriptions (あそこ in the second example) are followed by the に particle instead of the で particle as with other verbs
- place descriptions with ある usually come at the beginning of a sentence

**Other Uses of ある**

- saying you do or don't have or own something:

"テレビがありません" => "I don't own a TV"
"時間がありますか" => "Do you have the time?"

- saying when an event will occur (note that in this case, place descriptions are followed by で as they would be with other verbs)

"**明日****学校で**テストがあります" => "**Tomorrow**, there will be a test **at school**".

**Indicating People with いる**

If X is a person or other sentient being, use いる (る-verb) instead. The same notes on the usage of ある apply to いる:

"あそこに私の友達**がいます**" => "My friend **is** over there"

います/いません can also be used to say you do or do not have friends/siblings/etc:

"友達がいません" => "I don't have friends"

#### Describing Relative Locations

To describe the location of an object X relative to another object Y, we can say "XはYの_____" to say "X is _______ Y", where the blank is a location word:

| **Word** | **Meaning/Translation** |
| --- | --- |
| 右「みぎ」 | "Xは**Yの右**" => "X is **to the right of Y**" |
| 左「ひだり」 | "Xは**Yの左**" => "X is **to the left of Y**" |
| 前「まえ」 | "Xは**Yの前**" => "X is **in front of Y**" |
| 後ろ「うしろ」 | "Xは**Yの後ろ**" => "X is **behind Y**" |
| 中「なか」 | "Xは**Yの中**" => "X is **inside Y**" |
| 上「うえ」 | "Xは**Yの上**" => "X is **on/above Y**" |
| 下「した」 | "Xは**Yの下**" => "X is **below Y**" |
| 近く「ちかく」 | "Xは**Yの近く**" => "X is **near Y**" |
| 隣「となり」 | "Xは**Yの隣**" => "X is **next to Y**" |

In addition, the word 間「あいだ」 can be used to describe when X is between two objects:

"Xは**YとZの間**" => "X is **between Y and Z**"

#### Past Tense of です and じゃないです

| **Tense** | **Positive** | **Negative** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Present | ...Yです (...is Y) | ...Yじゃないです (...is not Y) |
| Past | ...Y**でした** (...**was** Y) | ...Y**じゃなかったです** (...**was not** Y) |

There are more formal forms of the past tense negative:

- "...Y**じゃありませんでした**" (speaking, more conservative)
- "...Y**ではありませんでした**" => (more formal written variant)

#### Past Tense of Verbs

Here, ~ is the stem of the verb (the rules regarding forming the stems of る/う/irregular verbs still apply):

| **Tense** | **Positive** | **Negative** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Present | ~ます | ~ません |
| Past | ~ま**した** | ~ません**でした** |

#### Other Uses of も

In general, も is a particle that's used to mark items on a list of things that have something in common. In addition to being able to refer to things that share an attribute (XはY...ZもY), も can also be used when:

- two or more people perform the same activity.

"私はハンバーガーをたべました。たけしさん**も**ハンバーガーを食べました" => "I ate a hamburger. Takeshi **also** ate a hamburger."

- someone buys, sees, or eats two or more things.

"私はハンバーガーを食べました。私はアイスクリーム**も**食べました" => "I ate a hamburger. I ate ice cream **too**."

In these cases, も directly replaced the を particle normally used with the direct object. In general, **も replaces the particles を, は and が** in these types of sentences.

も can also be used to say when someone goes to two or more places, or does the same thing on two or more occasions:

"私は京都に行きました。私は大阪**にも**行きました" => "I went to Kyoto. I went to Osaka **too**."

"私は土曜日に飲みました。私は日曜日**にも**飲みました" => "I drank on Saturday. I **also** drank on Sunday."

With particles other than を, は or が, **も is used after the existing particle instead of replacing it**.

#### Duration of Activities

- ___時間 can be used to say how many hours an activity lasted, without any particle following it.
- add 半 immediately after 時間 to indicate half an hour
- add ぐらい after the duration expression to say about or approximately how long

"私は日本語を**三時間半ぐらい**勉強しました" => "I studied Japanese for **about three and a half hours**."

#### Quantities

- たくさん means "a lot", and can be added before the direct object **or** after the を particle

"私は**たくさん**ハンバーガーを食べました" => "I ate **a lot of** hamburgers."

"私はお酒を**たくさん**飲みました" => "I drank **a lot of** alcohol."

#### The Particle と

- と can combine two nouns: "A**と**B" => "A **and** B"
- と can also be describe with whom an activity is performed (~"together with"):

"私は東京**と**大阪に友達**と**行きました" => "I went to Tokyo **and** Osaka **with** friends"
