### Genki Ch 4 Notes

#### Indicating Presence and Location with　あります and います

To say "There is X", where X is an object, we use the verbs ある and いる:

If X is an inanimate object or non-sentient animal, then the verb ある (う-verb) is used:

"本**があります**" => "**There is** a book"

"あそこ**に**カフェー**がありません**" => "**There is no** cafe over there"

Some notes:

- thing descriptions (本 and カフェ above) are followed by the が particle instead of the は particle as with other verbs
- place descriptions (あそこ in the second example) are followed by the に particle instead of the で particle as with other verbs
- place descriptions with ある usually come at the beginning of a sentence

**Other Uses of ある**

- saying you do or don't have or own something:

"テレビがありません" => "I don't own a TV"
"時間がありますか" => "Do you have the time?"

- saying when an event will occur (note that in this case, place descriptions are followed by で as they would be with other verbs)

"**明日****学校で**テストがあります" => "**Tomorrow**, there will be a test **at school**".

**Indicating People with いる**

If X is a person or other sentient being, use いる (る-verb) instead. The same notes on the usage of ある apply to いる:

"あそこに私の友達**がいます**" => "My friend **is** over there"

います/いません can also be used to say you do or do not have friends/siblings/etc:

"友達がいません" => "I don't have friends"

#### Describing Relative Locations

To describe the location of an object X relative to another object Y, we can say "XはYの_____" to say "X is _______ Y", where the blank is a location word:

| **Word** | **Meaning/Translation** |
| --- | --- |
| 右「みぎ」 | "Xは**Yの右**" => "X is **to the right of Y**" |
| 左「ひだり」 | "Xは**Yの左**" => "X is **to the left of Y**" |
| 前「まえ」 | "Xは**Yの前**" => "X is **in front of Y**" |
| 後ろ「うしろ」 | "Xは**Yの後ろ**" => "X is **behind Y**" |
| 中「なか」 | "Xは**Yの中**" => "X is **inside Y**" |
| 上「うえ」 | "Xは**Yの上**" => "X is **on/above Y**" |
| 下「した」 | "Xは**Yの下**" => "X is **below Y**" |
| 近く「ちかく」 | "Xは**Yの近く**" => "X is **near Y**" |
| 隣「となり」 | "Xは**Yの隣**" => "X is **next to Y**" |

In addition, the word 間「あいだ」 can be used to describe when X is between two objects:

"Xは**YとZの間**" => "X is **between Y and Z**"
